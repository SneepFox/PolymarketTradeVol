This is an additional program for the project of user 0xJohn for creating an account farm and increasing transaction volumes in the Polymarket project, in which I implemented the functionality I needed, which he did not do in his project. The project is designed to process wallet data from an Excel file, retrieve volume data from Polymarket, and retrieve USD balances using the Polygonscan API. The results are updated in the same Excel file.



Features

- Reads wallet addresses from an Excel file (`data.xlsx`).
- Fetches trading volume data from Polymarket for each wallet.
- Retrieves USDC balance for each wallet using the Polygonscan API.
- Saves the results back into the Excel file in columns F (Volume) and G (USDC Balance).
